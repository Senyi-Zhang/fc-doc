## Module 1: Atomic Claim Extraction

The primary objective of Module 1: Atomic Claim Extraction is to meticulously parse complex paragraphs and distill them into a series of discrete, atomic factual statements. Each extracted claim is intended to be contextually independent, allowing for focused verification in subsequent modules.

Leveraging the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), many traditional challenges in claim extraction are significantly mitigated. We anticipate minimal issues concerning co-reference resolution (i.e., correctly identifying who "he" or "it" refers to), ensuring the extracted claims are genuinely independent of their immediate textual surroundings, or judging whether a statement constitutes a verifiable factual assertion worthy of fact-checking.

Despite these advantages, the iterative nature of claim extraction presents unique questions. The following outlines several key challenge explored and our current approach:

### Challenge 1: Determining Extraction Stoppage

A critical question arises when the system continuously extracts claims from a paragraph without immediately identifying any factual errors: **When should the claim extraction process for a given paragraph cease?**

Several strategies have been considered:

* **Approach 1 (Attempted and Deemed Suboptimal): Relying on LLM Self-Termination**
    * **Description:** This approach involved allowing the LLM to determine when it had exhaustively extracted all perceivable claims from the paragraph.
    * **Outcome:** Experimental results indicated that this method is unreliable. LLMs often concluded the extraction process prematurely, failing to identify all statements that would be valuable candidates for fact-checking.

* **Approach 2 (Current Implemented Solution): Utilizing External Logic / Heuristic Algorithm**
    * **Description:** To ensure a more consistent and controllable extraction process, we employ an external logic to decide when to stop querying the LLM for more claims from the current paragraph.
    * **Current Heuristic:** We are currently utilizing a straightforward threshold-based heuristic. The system stops extracting further claims when the total number of statements already extracted for the paragraph exceeds a value equivalent to `(Total Number of Sentences in the Paragraph) / 2.5`.
    * **Performance:** This empirical threshold provides an acceptable balance between extraction thoroughness and processing efficiency in our current testing scenarios, particularly as an initial greedy strategy when no errors are immediately apparent. Further refinement and exploration of more dynamic heuristics are ongoing.
