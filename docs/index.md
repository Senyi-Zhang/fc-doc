# Project Veracity: Advanced Fact-Checking System

## 1. Overview

Project Veracity is a sophisticated fact-checking system designed to meticulously analyze textual content and identify factual inaccuracies with an exceptional degree of precision. In an era informacija (and misinformation) overload, the ability to swiftly and reliably verify the veracity of claims presented in written material is paramount. This system aims to provide a robust solution by systematically deconstructing a given text, evaluating its constituent claims against credible evidence, and delivering a clear assessment of its factual accuracy. Our primary objective is to achieve ultimate accuracy in fact-verification.

## 2. Problem Statement

The proliferation of misinformation and disinformation poses significant challenges across various domains, from journalism and public discourse to academic research and everyday information consumption. Manually verifying long-form content is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often impractical at scale. Existing automated solutions may lack the nuanced understanding required to achieve high accuracy, especially when dealing with complex statements, subtle inaccuracies, or claims requiring sophisticated reasoning. There is a critical need for an advanced system that can dissect text, identify verifiable claims, and rigorously assess their truthfulness with near-human levels of accuracy.

## 3. Proposed Solution: System Architecture

Project Veracity employs an iterative, modular approach to fact-checking:

**Input:** A long passage of text.

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Claim Extraction:**
    * The system intelligently identifies individual, verifiable factual statements (claims) within the input text.
    * A running `processed_claims_set` is maintained to avoid redundant analysis of identical claims.

2.  **Evidence Retrieval:**
    * For each extracted claim, the system queries a comprehensive set of trusted knowledge sources (e.g., search engines, academic databases, knowledge graphs, reputable news archives) to gather relevant evidence.
    * Advanced query formulation techniques are employed to maximize the relevance and quality of retrieved evidence.

3.  **Evidence-Claim Relevance Analysis:**
    * The retrieved evidence is critically assessed to determine its direct relevance to the claim in question.
    * Sophisticated semantic analysis ensures that the evidence genuinely pertains to the core assertion of the claim.

4.  **Claim Verification & Factual Adjudication:**
    * If relevant evidence is found, the system evaluates the claim against this evidence to determine its factual correctness.
    * This module assesses whether the evidence supports, refutes, or provides insufficient information regarding the claim.
    * **Accuracy Focus:** To achieve ultimate accuracy, this stage (and others like claim extraction and relevance analysis) will leverage state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) APIs (e.g., GPT-series, Gemini) for their advanced reasoning, comprehension, and NLI (Natural Language Inference) capabilities.

5.  **Iterative Processing & Output Generation:**
    * If a claim is determined to be incorrect, the system can be configured to either:
        * Immediately report the first identified inaccuracy.
        * Continue processing to identify all factual errors within the passage.
    * Successfully verified or irrelevant claims are added to the `processed_claims_set`.
    * The loop continues until all unique, verifiable claims are processed or a critical error is found (based on configuration).
    * The final output will detail any identified factual errors, along with supporting evidence and explanations.

## 4. Key Features & Modules

* **Automated Claim Identification:** Pinpoints discrete, fact-checkable statements from complex narratives.
* **Multi-Source Evidence Aggregation:** Gathers information from diverse and credible sources.
* **Semantic Relevance Engine:** Accurately matches evidence to claims based on meaning, not just keywords.
* **LLM-Powered Verification Core:** Utilizes cutting-edge LLM APIs for superior accuracy in claim understanding, evidence interpretation, and truthfulness assessment.
* **Iterative Deep-Dive Analysis:** Systematically processes text to ensure comprehensive coverage.
* **Detailed Error Reporting:** Provides clear explanations and cites evidence for any identified inaccuracies.
* **Configurable Sensitivity:** Allows for adjustments in how strictly claims are interpreted and how errors are reported.

## 5. Technology Stack (Preliminary)

* **Core Logic:** Python
* **Natural Language Processing & Understanding:**
    * Large Language Model APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-series, Google Gemini) for core tasks:
        * Advanced Claim Extraction
        * Nuanced Evidence-Claim Relevance Analysis
        * High-Accuracy Claim Verification & Reasoning
    * Traditional NLP Libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for preprocessing and supplementary tasks.
* **Evidence Retrieval:** APIs for search engines (e.g., Google Search API), academic databases, and knowledge graphs.
* **Data Management:** Suitable database for storing processed claims, evidence snippets, and knowledge bases.
